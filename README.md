------------------GUESS THE NUMBER------------------

Guess the correct number.
By default, this is a number betwee 1 and 20.

There is an option to set your own numbers.
Use the input fields on the right side to set a max. number and a min. number.
Negative values are allowed, for instance you can generate a random number between -20 and -30 or 10 and -10.

If you guessed the correct number, you can either start a new game by setting a new min. and max. number and click the again button (top-left).

If you reset the game via the again button, a random number between 1 and 20 is generated again.
